## News

+ [2026/4/8] ClawGUI is released — train with ClawGUI-RL (GiGPO), evaluate with ClawGUI-Eval, deploy with ClawGUI-Agent. ClawGUI-2B, a 2B agent trained end-to-end with this pipeline, hits **17.1** MobileWorld SR vs. the **11.1** baseline. See [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

## 💡 Overview

**ClawGUI** is a research framework for GUI agents, covering the complete lifecycle from **online RL training** and **standardized evaluation** to **real-device deployment**.

Building a capable GUI agent involves three tightly coupled problems that are rarely solved together: you need an environment to train the agent online, rigorous benchmarks to measure what it has learned, and a production system to deploy it on real devices. ClawGUI addresses all three.

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| 🚀 **[ClawGUI-RL](clawgui-rl/)** | **Build** — Train GUI agents online with scalable RL: parallel Docker environments, real Android devices, and GiGPO+PRM for fine-grained step-level rewards |
| 📊 **[ClawGUI-Eval](clawgui-eval/)** | **Evaluate** — Measure what the agent has learned: 6 benchmarks, 11+ models, 95.8% faithful reproduction of official results |
| 🤖 **[ClawGUI-Agent](clawgui-agent/)** | **Deploy** — Use GUI agents in the real world: control mobile devices via natural language through 12+ chat platforms, with one-command evaluation built in |
| 🏆 **ClawGUI-2B** | End-to-end validation: trained entirely with ClawGUI-RL and GiGPO, achieving **17.1** MobileWorld SR vs. the **11.1** baseline |

### 🚀 ClawGUI-RL — Build

> 📁 [`clawgui-rl/`](clawgui-rl/) · 📖 [Full Documentation](clawgui-rl/README.md)

ClawGUI-RL trains GUI agents with online reinforcement learning. It runs dozens of Docker-based Android emulators in parallel or trains directly on physical devices — and replaces standard GRPO with GiGPO+PRM for fine-grained step-level rewards that drive stronger policy learning.

- **Parallel multi-environment** — Dozens of Docker-based virtual Android environments simultaneously
- **Real-device training** — Physical or cloud Android phones with the same API
- **GiGPO + PRM** — Fine-grained step-level reward for better policy optimization than standard GRPO
- **Spare server rotation** — Automatic failover keeps training running without interruption
- **Episode visualization** — Record and replay any training trajectory

### 📊 ClawGUI-Eval — Evaluate

> 📁 [`clawgui-eval/`](clawgui-eval/) · 📖 [Full Documentation](clawgui-eval/README.md) · [🤗 Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/johnzqlu/clawgui-eval) · [🤖 ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/Matrix0602/clawgui-eval)

ClawGUI-Eval gives GUI grounding research a reliable measurement baseline. Its three-stage **Infer → Judge → Metric** pipeline covers 6 benchmarks and 11+ models, with a **95.8%** reproduction rate against official results — so numbers across papers are actually comparable.

- **6 benchmarks** — ScreenSpot-Pro, ScreenSpot-V2, UIVision, MMBench-GUI, OSWorld-G, AndroidControl
- **11+ models** — Qwen3-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, UI-TARS, MAI-UI, GUI-G2, UI-Venus, Gemini, Seed 1.8, and more
- **Dual backend** — Local GPU (`transformers`) or remote API (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Multi-GPU & multi-thread** — Parallel inference with automatic resume
- **ClawGUI-Agent integration** — Pair with ClawGUI-Agent to run the full pipeline via natural language

### 🤖 ClawGUI-Agent — Deploy

> 📁 [`clawgui-agent/`](clawgui-agent/) · 📖 [Full Documentation](clawgui-agent/README.md) · [English](clawgui-agent/README_EN.md)

ClawGUI-Agent closes the loop from training to production. Built on OpenClaw and powered by nanobot, it lets you control Android, HarmonyOS, or iOS devices with natural language from 12+ chat platforms — and trigger the full ClawGUI-Eval benchmark pipeline with a single sentence, no scripts required.

- **Cross-platform** — Android (ADB), HarmonyOS (HDC), iOS (XCTest)
- **Multi-model** — AutoGLM, MAI-UI, GUI-Owl, Qwen-VL, UI-TARS via OpenAI-compatible API
- **One-command evaluation** — Say "benchmark qwen3vl on screenspot-pro" and it handles env check → multi-GPU inference → judging → metrics → result comparison
- **Personalized memory** — Automatically learns user preferences and injects context across tasks
- **Episode recording** — Every task saved as structured episodes for replay and dataset building
- **Web UI** — Gradio interface for device management, task execution, and memory inspection
